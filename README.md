DS H008 v2 is the second version of the calendar watch face. It is built using WFF (Watch Face Format v2) and a static complication (the calendar), therefore it can now be installed on watches with Wear OS 5 and bellow. Besides the watch face, now the watch app contains a tile that follows the same style (in case you don't want to use the watch face).
The project also includes a phone app. It can be used to install/update the watch app easily. The phone app provides a widget to be used on the phone home screen as well.

### FAQ (Saving your time [and mine])

1) Where can I download the version 1?
> Version 1 is available on google play for free, you can officially download it [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.dect.wear.watchface.dsh008). Version 1 uses the old jetpack api to build the watch face, therefore it is not available for watches that comes with Wear OS 5. It also has some limitations (it shows only the current half of the day, for example) and a few bugs (reported).

2) Will you update the version 1 calendar code to version 2 (this code) on google play?
> No, 2 reasons:
 > One, I lost (backups are outdated) the code/projects for a couple of projects I have on google play (no way of updating them, unless I build them from zero or work on the outdated backups);
 > Two, this code (as I am using WFF and I built from zero haha) is completely different from the one on version 1, so a lot of adaptations would be necessary (again version 1 uses the jetpack api).

3) Why don't you upload this version on google play?
> Well, 3 reasons (sort of):
 > One, I'm not in the mood to deal with google's "rules" and reviews for wear os publishing, and there are quite a few;
 > Two, even if I was in the mood, it wouldn't be approved. One of google's new rules for watch faces is that they must be build using WFF, and the .aab file [MUST NOT](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/wff/setup#declare-wff-use) contain any code. As my watch face file contains a complication (code) they wouldn't aprove it. Only if I publish the watch face and the complication in separated project, then you would install both and set them by yourself (ðŸ˜–, for sure it would give me some headache, with some users).
 > Three, this project is build using complication. Complications are complicated (haha), they have limitations, especially when it comes to update frequency. In other words, this project have some "delays" when it comes to updating the calendar (for example, it sets coding alarms and sometimes you might need to tap the watch face to update), combine this "issue" with google's review policy and it wouldn't be approved...

4) Does it shows tomorrow events? What is the scissor icon?
> Only if it starts today. Even though it would be "cut" at midnight. The watch face shows only the events from today!
> The scissor icon is for events that had their "time cut" to be displayed (the event time won't change on your calendar, it will only be displayed differently, for example, if it ends after midnight it will be displayed (today) until midnight and after midnight it will display as if it started midnight).

5) Why can't I add more than one watch face?
> As I need an external way of updating the complication, adding multiple "favorites" would get complex...

6) When does it updates/refresh? What frequency?
> Seven cases:
 > 1, you tap the watch face;
 > 2, you open and close the watch app;
 > 3, approximately one minute after a event ends;
 > 4, every 1 hour after the last update (in case of no events, if there is an event it falls back on case 3);
 > 5, when you add/remove/update and event (phone app must be installed for this to work);
 > 6, when day changes;
 > 7, when you change/set the watch face.

7) Why it is not updating/refreshing?
> Well, Wear OS limits what an app can do (so it saves battery, as it is badly optimized). Check if the app was not added to the sleeping list (sometimes Wear OS adds it automatically to this list), in case it is, it won't update automatically until you remove it, you will need to tap the watch face to update. Also, it might not update while the watch is in some modes, like: aod, sleeping, battery saving, etc.

8) Can I change the order of the events? Can I add a custom event to the app? Can I change the event color? Where does the events come from?
> The events comes from your phone's calendar. As long as your watch and you phone are using the same account for the calendar, it should display the events without no problem. It will display all day events first then order the rest by their start time. For now is not possible to add custom events (maybe in a future update, maybe!). The event info is the one your calendar provides (title, color, start and end time) you must set those infos inside your calendar app.

9) Can I set a digital clock?
> Ish. I added a analog hand with a digital clock on it. The WFF is limited, I cannot change the position of the complications after it is set, so adding a digital clock like the one on version 1 is not possible.

10) Why the complication color doesn't follow the ones I set?
> WFF fault. It happens with other watch faces too.

11) Can I change the tile hand style/color?
> No, for now you can show/hide the minute hand, again, maybe in the future.

12) Why a tile?
> Updates only when you navigates to it, so it saves more battery, besides some people might not like the watch face but still want a different kind of calendar on their watch.

13) Why no digital hand on widget?
> Too complicated to add, widgets design are also limited, for a good reason. Maybe in future I add a digital clock widget with the calendar around it.

14) Does the watch and phone settings sync?
> Yes, but you have to click on sync every time you wish to make the watch match the phones settings.
